But at this point we have made an online questionnaire for the citizens of Tampere and picked up some attitudes and ideas from them and read scientific literature reladted to sharing economy and our work generally. We have chosen to use UX Lifecycle Model ContinUE in our project and learnt from that. The design process has focused to defining UX goals and for that we have learnt some techniques.
